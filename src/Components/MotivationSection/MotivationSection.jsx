          <p>
          As a temporary executive, I aim to do more than just fill leadership gaps or manage strategic projects. I see my role as also acting as a role model in areas such as corporate culture and ethics. A key advantage I bring is knowledge transfer, developed through years of experience and frequent exposure to different corporate environments. 
          I value the opportunity to create impact in a short time.
